      Really sorry for doing this. But This is the only last minute solution i
      could think off.
      <p>
        You can just treat my submission as any other submission and if i win i
        will request the cash using this option

      {/* eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element */}
      <img src="/paypal-me.png" alt="" className="w-1/2 aspect-video my-10" />
      <p>
        Hope it wont be a problem. There wll be no legal ramifications of any
        sort. Im sorry for bothering you. I just assumed that since paypal is in
        my country, paypal.me would be too but turns out nope. And this is after
        completing the whole project
      </p>
